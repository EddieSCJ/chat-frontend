# Chat Frontend

A simple web react app to provide support in learning how to use socket.io built on [Backend Project](https://github.com/EddieSCJ/chat-api)

### How it works?
The username data is saved in localstorage (I needed to do this project fast because the main focus was in kafka and socket.io) and after you typed your username it will be saved in the browser, so you can start to type your messages

If you wanna simulate two different chats and users, just open a private navigation (incognito mode) and repeat the process.

### How can I run it?
* First download and run the backend project
* Just download the project and type npm start (maybe you need type npm install before)
